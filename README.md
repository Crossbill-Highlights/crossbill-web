# Crossbill

[![CI](https://github.com/Tumetsu/Crossbill/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Tumetsu/Crossbill/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Docker Image Version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/tumetsu/crossbill?sort=semver)](https://hub.docker.com/r/tumetsu/crossbill)

A self-hosted reading companion web app for managing highlights, creating flash cards and improve your reading with e-readers using Koreader.

## Overview

Crossbill helps you centralize and manage your ebook highlights by providing:

- **Backend API**: FastAPI server with PostgreSQL database for storing highlights
- **Web Frontend**: Modern React interface for browsing, editing, and organizing your highlights
- **[KOReader Plugin](https://github.com/Crossbill-Highlights/koreader-plugin)**: Syncs highlights directly from your KOReader e-reader
- **[Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/Crossbill-Highlights/obsidian-plugin)**: Integrate highlights into your Obsidian notes
- [**Anki Plugin**](https://github.com/Crossbill-Highlights/anki-addon): Integrate highlights into your Anki flash cards

## Features

- Sync highlights from KOReader with automatic deduplication
- Web interface for viewing and managing highlights by book
- Organize highlights with notes and metadata
- Create flash cards from your highlights and sync them to Anki or get AI suggestions from highlights.
- Create AI summaries from your reading sessions. Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini supported.
- Self-hosted - your data stays on your server
- Multi-user support

## Installation

Easiest way to install and run Crossbill is by using sample `docker-compose.yml` on top level of this repository.

1. Copy the example environment file to the project root and fill in your values:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

2. Then start the services:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Then install the Koreader [plugin on your e-reader](clients/koreader-plugin/crossbill.koplugin/README.md).

### Background Worker

The `docker-compose.yml` includes an optional `worker` service that processes background jobs (e.g., batch AI prereading generation for book chapters). It uses the same Docker image as the main app with a different entrypoint.

The worker requires AI provider configuration (`AI_PROVIDER`, API keys) to process AI-related tasks. You can adjust concurrency via `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` (default: 5).

For development, run the worker separately:

```bash
make dev-worker
```

### S3-Compatible Storage (Optional)

By default, Crossbill stores ebook files and covers on the local filesystem. For multi-container deployments (e.g., Railway) where the app and worker containers cannot share a filesystem, you can configure S3-compatible storage so both containers access the same files.

Set these environment variables to enable S3 storage:

```
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://your-s3-endpoint.example.com
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=crossbill-files
S3_REGION=your-region
```

When these are set, Crossbill automatically uses S3 instead of local disk. When they are not set, local file storage is used (the `book-files` volume mount).

For local development or self-hosted server, you can use [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) as an S3-compatible server. The `docker-compose.yml` includes an optional `garage` service. 
Start it and run the one-time setup script:

```bash
docker compose up -d garage
./scripts/setup_garage.sh

# After setting the environment variables restart containers if they are already running:
docker restart crossbill-app crossbill-worker
```

The script creates the bucket and API key, then prints the credentials to add to your `.env`. If you are going to use Garage in production, please refer [their docs](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/)
for proper settings to be set in the `garage.toml`!

## Development

Each component has its own installation instructions for development:

- **Backend**: See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)
- **Frontend**: See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md)

API documentation can be found from URL `<backend host>/api/v1/docs` when running the backend server.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Few guide lines:

- Check if there is an issue you would like to work on and comment on it to discuss
- Add first issue about the feature etc. you'd like to see in the application (and work on if possible!)
- AI-assisted coding is welcome as long as you review your contributions before submitting them to the review.
