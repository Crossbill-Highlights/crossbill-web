# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute! You can pick some of the issues or if you have idea or feature you'd like to see, open an issue and PR about it. 

## Guidelines on work flow
- Open issue if you want a new feature etc. If you have some idea you'd like to implement, open issue in addition of PR so that we can discuss about it. However, just PR is fine too.
- AI usage is fine provided you review its output before submitting PR to review. Personally I have heavily used and experimented AI and agentic coding in this project but always review the output request changes.
- With AI tools, please follow rules in Claude.md and skills directory. If you use other agents, take care they follow same rules.

## Code conventions
- Follow hexagonal architecture style in the backend
- Write or have AI to write unit tests or api tests for the new backend functionality
- Passing linter, tests and strong typing are must!
