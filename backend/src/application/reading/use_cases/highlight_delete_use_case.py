        Soft delete highlights from a book.

        This performs a soft delete by marking the highlights as deleted.
        When syncing highlights, deleted highlights will not be recreated,
        ensuring that user deletions persist across syncs.

        Also cascades to delete all bookmarks and flashcards associated with
        the deleted highlights.
